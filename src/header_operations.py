# [ Z00 ] INTRODUCTION AND CREDITS
################################################################################

  # Everyone who has ever tried to mod Mount&Blade games knows perfectly well,
  # that the documentation for it's Module System is severely lacking. Warband
  # Module System, while introducing many new and useful operations, did not
  # improve considerably in the way of documentation. What's worse, a number of
  # outright errors and inconsistencies appeared between what was documented in
  # the comments to the header_operations.py file (which was the root source of
  # all Warband scripting documentation, whether you like it or not), and what
  # was actually implemented in the game engine.

  # Sooner or later someone was bound to dedicate some time and effort to fix
  # this problem by properly documenting the file. It just so happened that I
  # was the first person crazy enough to accept the challenge.

  # I have tried to make this file a self-sufficient source of information on
  # every operation that the Warband scripting engine knows of. Naturally I
  # failed - there are still many operations for which there is simply not
  # enough information, or operations with effects that have not yet been
  # thoroughly tested and confirmed. But as far as I know, there is currently
  # no other reference more exhaustive than this. I tried to make the file
  # useful to both seasoned scripters and complete newbies, and to a certain
  # degree this file can even serve as a tutorial into Warband scripting -
  # though it still won't replace the wealth of tutorials produced by the
  # Warband modding community.

  # I really hope you will find it useful as well.

  #                                    Alexander Lomski AKA Lav. Jan 18th, 2012.

  # And the credits.

  # First of all, I should credit Taleworlds for the creation of this game and
  # it's Module System. Without them, I wouldn't be able to work on this file
  # so even though I'm often sceptical about their programming style and quality
  # of their code, they still did a damn good job delivering this game to all
  # of us.

  # And then I should credit many members from the Warband modding community
  # who have shared their knowledge and helped me clear out many uncertainties
  # and inconsistencies. Special credits (in no particular order) go to
  # cmpxchg8b, Caba'drin, SonKidd, MadVader, dunde, Ikaguia, MadocComadrin,
  # Cjkjvfnby, shokkueibu.

# [ Z03 ] MATHEMATICAL OPERATIONS
################################################################################

  # Mathematical operations deal with numbers. Warband Module System can only
  # deal with integers. Floating point numbers are emulated by the so-called
  # "fixed point numbers". Wherever you encounter a fixed point parameter for
  # some Module System operation, keep in mind that it is actually just a
  # regular integer number, HOWEVER it is supposed to represent a floating
  # point number equal to fixed_point_number / fixed_point_multiplier. As you
  # might have guessed, to convert a floating point number to fixed point, you
  # have to multiply it by fixed_point_multiplier. You can change the value of
  # multiplier with the operation (set_fixed_point_multiplier), thus influencing
  # the precision of all operations dealing with fixed point numbers.

  # A notion very important for Warband modding is that you reference all
  # Warband objects by their numeric values. In other words, you can do maths
  # with your items, troops, agents, scenes, parties et cetera. This is used
  # extensively in the code, so don't be surprised to see code looking like
  # (store_add, ":value", "itm_pike", 4). This code is just calculating a
  # reference to an item which is located 4 positions after "itm_pike" inside
  # the module_items.py file.

# [ Z04 ] SCRIPT/TRIGGER PARAMETERS AND RESULTS
################################################################################

  # Many scripts can accept additional parameters, and many triggers have some
  # parameters of their own (as details in header_triggers.py file). You can
  # only pass numeric values as parameters. Since string constants are also
  # Warband objects, you can pass them as well, and you can also pass string
  # or position registers. However you cannot pass quick strings (string
  # defined directly in the code).

  # You can declare your scripts with as many parameters as you wish. Triggers,
  # however, are always called with their predefined parameters. Also the game
  # engine does not support more than 3 parameters per trigger. As the result,
  # some triggers receive extra information which could not be fit into those
  # three parameters in numeric, string or position registers.

  # Some triggers and scripts called from the game engine (those have names
  # starting with "game_") expect you to return some value to the game engine.
  # That value may be either a number or a string and is set by special
  # operations listed below. Scripts called from the Module System, however,
  # typically use registers to store their return data.

  # Note that if you call a script from a trigger, you can still use operations

# [ Z09 ] PARTIES AND PARTY TEMPLATES
################################################################################

  # Parties are extremely important element of single-player modding, because
  # they are the only object which can be present on the world map. Each party
  # is a semi-independent object with it's own behavior. Note that you cannot
  # control party's behavior directly, instead you can change various factors
  # which affect party behavior (including party AI settings).

  # There are two things of importance when dealing with parties. First, parties
  # can be attached to each other, this allows you, for example, to stack a
  # number of armies inside a single city. Second, parties may encounter each
  # other. When two AI parties are in encounter, it usually means they are
  # fighting. Player's encounter with an AI party is usually much more complex
  # and may involve pretty much anything, which is why player's encounters are
  # covered in a separate section of the file.

  # Each party consists of troop stacks. Each troop stack is either a single
  # hero (troop defined as tf_hero in module_troops.py file) or a number of
  # regular troops (their number may vary from 1 and above). Each party has two
  # sets of troop stacks: members (or companions) set of stacks, and prisoners
  # set of stacks. Many operations will only affect members, others may only
  # affect prisoners, and there are even operations to switch their roles.

  # Another important concept is a party template. It's definition looks very
  # similar to a party. Templates are used when there's a need to create a
  # number of parties with similar set of members, parameters or flags. Also
  # templates can be easily used to differentiate parties from each other,
  # so they are akin to a "party_type" in the game.

  # Note that parties are the only game object which is persistent (i.e. it
  # will be saved to the savegame file and restored on load), has slots and
  # can be created during runtime. This makes parties ideal candidates for
  # dynamic information storage of unlimited volume, which the game otherwise
  # lacks.

# [ Z10 ] TROOPS
################################################################################

  # What troops are.

  # There are two major types of troops: heroes and regulars. They are treated
  # very differently by the game, so it's important not to confuse them. At the
  # same time, most Module System operations will not make any differentiation
  # between hero and regular troops.

  # First of all, hero troops do not stack. You cannot have a stack of heroes
  # in a party, each hero will always occupy a separate troop slot. At the same
  # time, you can put any number of regular troops into a single troop slot.

  # Second, the way the game treats equipment of heroes and troops is also
  # different. All heroes' items are treated in the same way as player's (no
  # big surprise, since player is actually a hero troop himself). Meanwhile,
  # items that the troop has are just suggestions for what this troop *might*
  # take into battle. On the battlefield, each agent spawned from the regular
  # troop, will only take a limited number of items from the inventory provided
  # by the troop definition in module_troops.py. Choice is absolutely random and
  # modder has only limited control over it through the use of guarantee flags.
  # There's one more additional caveat: while you can easily change the outfit
  # of a hero troop and your changes will persist through the game, same applies
  # to regular troops. In other words, by changing equipment of some regular
  # troop, you are changing all instances of that troop throughout the entire
  # game. In other words, you cannot re-equip a stack of regulars in a single
  # party - your changes will affect all parties in the world.

  # Third, while all heroes have a single predefined face code, which is used
  # consistently through the game, troops have entire range of face codes. This
  # range is used to randomize each agent's face within those constraints, so a
  # group of 12 pikemen will not look like a bunch of clones.

  # Fourth, hero troops can't be killed in battle. Every time hero's hit points
  # are reduced to zero, hero is always knocked down. For regular troops, chance
  # to be knocked down depends on the number of factors, but their default fate
  # when driven to zero health is death.

  # There are two types of sound in the game: sounds and tracks. Sounds are just
  # short sound effects. They can be positional (i.e. emitted by some object on
  # the scene or by player's opponent during the dialog). They can be generic
  # sound effects, like playing some drums when player meets mountain bandits.

  # Tracks are the background music. The game works as a kind of a musuc box,
  # cycling the available melodies according to the situation. It is up to the
  # Module System developer, however, to tell the game what the situation is.
  # There are two factors which you can tell the game: situation and culture.
  # So you can tell the game that the situation is "ambush" and the culture is
  # "khergits", and the game will select the musuc tracks which fit this
  # combination of situation and culture and will rotate them randomly. And of
  # course, you can also tell the game to play one specific track if you want.

# [ Z14 ] POSITIONS
################################################################################

  # Positions are the 3D math of the game. If you want to handle objects in
  # space, you will inevitably have to deal with positions. Note that while most
  # position-handling operations work both on global map and on the scenes,
  # there are operations which will only work in one or another mode.

  # Each position consists of three parts: coordinates, rotation and scale.

  # Coordinates are three numbers - (X,Y,Z) - which define a certain point in
  # space relative to the base of coordinates. Most of the time, the base of
  # coordinates is either the center of the global map, or the center of the
  # scene, but there may be exceptions. Note that all operations with
  # coordinates nearly always use fixed point numbers.

  # Position rotation determines just that - rotation around corresponding
  # world axis. So rotation around Z axis means rotation around vertical axis,
  # in other words - turning right and left. Rotation around X and Y axis will
  # tilt the position forward/backwards and right/left respectively.

  # It is common game convention that X world axis points to the East, Y world
  # axis points to the North and Z world axis points straight up. However this
  # is so-called global coordinates system, and more often than not you'll be
  # dealing with local coordinates. Local coordinates are the coordinate system
  # defined by the object's current position. For the object, his X axis is to
  # the right, Y axis is forward, and Z axis is up. This is simple enough, but
  # consider what happens if that object is turned upside down in world space?
  # Object's Z axis will point upwards *from the object's point of view*, in
  # other words, in global space it will be pointing *downwards*. And if the
  # object is moving, then it's local coordinates system is moving with it...
  # you get the idea.

  # Imagine the position as a small point with an arrow somewhere in space.
  # Position's coordinates are the point's position. Arrow points horizontally
  # to the North by default, and position's rotation determines how much was
  # it turned in the each of three directions.

  # Final element of position is scale. It is of no direct relevance to the
  # position itself, and it does not participate in any calculations. However
  # it is important when you retrieve or set positions of objects. In this
  # case, position's scale is object's scale - so you can shrink that wall
  # or quite the opposite, make it grow to the sky, depending on your whim.

In other words, if you have some position on the scene (anchor) and a position describing some place *relative* to anchor (for example [10,20,0] means "20 meters forward and 10 meters to the right"), after calling this operation you will get that position coordinates on the scene in <position_dest>.

Suppose you want to run some decision making for your bot agent depending on player's position. In order to know where player is located relative to your bot you call (position_transform_position_to_local, <position_dest>, <bot_position>, <player_position>). Then we check position_dest's Y coordinate - if it's negative, then the player is behind our bot's back.

  # Tableaus are the tool that gives you limited access to the game graphical
  # renderer. If you know 3D graphics, you know that all 3D objects consist of
  # a mesh (which defines it's form) and the material (which defines how this
  # mesh is "painted"). With tableau functions you can do two things. First, you
  # can replace or alter the materials used to render the game objects (with
  # many restrictions). If this sounds esoteric to you, have a look at the game
  # heraldry - it is implemented using tableaus. Second, you can render images
  # of various game objects and place them on the game menus, presentations and
  # so on. For example, if you open the game Inventory window, you can see your
  # character in his current equipment. This character is rendered using tableau
  # operations. Similarly, if you open the Notes screen and select some kingdom
  # lord on the Troops section, you will see that lord's face and banner. Both
  # face and banner are drawn using tableaus.

# [ Z17 ] STRING OPERATIONS
################################################################################

  # The game provides you only limited control over string information. Most
  # operations will either retrieve some string (usually the name) from the game
  # object, or set that object's name to a string.

  # Two important functions are str_store_string and str_store_string_reg. They
  # are different from all others because they not only assign the string to a
  # string register, they *process* it. For example, if source string contains
  # "{reg3}", then the resulting string will have the register name and it's
  # surrounding brackets replaced with the value currently stored in that
  # register. Other strings can be substituted as well, and even some limited
  # logic can be implemented using this mechanism. You can try to read through
  # the module_strings.py file and try to deduce what each particular
  # substitution does.

  # An encounter is what happens when player's party meets another party on the
  # world map. While most operations in the game can be performed outside of
  # encounter, there's one thing you can only do when in encounter context -
  # standard game battle. When you are initiating the battle from an encounter,
  # the game engine will do most of the grunt work for you. You can order the
  # engine to add some parties to the battle on this or that side, and the
  # soldiers from those parties will spawn on the battlefield, in the numbers
  # proportional to the party sizes, and the agents will maintain links with
  # their parties. If agents earn experience, this will be reflected on the
  # world map, and if some agents die, party sizes will be decreased. All this
  # stuff can potentially be emulated by the Module System code, but it's tons
  # of work and is still much less efficient than the tool the game engine
  # already provides to you.

  # An important notice: when player encounters an AI party on the map, the game
  # calls "game_event_party_encounter" script in the module_scripts.py. So if
  # you want to implement some non-standard processing of game encounters, this
  # is the place you should start from. Also note that the game implements the
  # Camp menu as an encounter with a hardcoded party "p_camp_bandits".

  # Also you can find many operations in this section dealing with game screens,
  # game menus and game dialogs. Keep in mind that some screens only make sense
  # in certain contexts, and game menus are only available on the world map, you
  # cannot use game menus during the mission.

  # On each scene in the game you can find scene props and scene items.

  # Scene props are the building bricks of the scene. Nearly every 3D object you
  # will see on any scene in the game is a scene prop, with the exception of
  # terrain and flora (on some scenes flora elements are actually scene props
  # as well though).

  # Just like with troops and agents, it is important to differentiate between
  # scene props and scene prop instances. You can have a dozen archer agents on
  # the scene, and each of them will be an instance of the archer troop. Scene
  # props are the same - there can be many castle wall sections on the scene,
  # and these are instances of the same castle wall scene prop.

  # It is also possible to use game items as elements of the scene. These are
  # the scene items, and they behave just like normal scene props. However all
  # operations will affect either scene prop instances, or scene items, but
  # not both.

  # Finally, there are spawned items. These are the "dropped" items which the
  # player can pick up during the mission.

# [ Z22 ] AGENTS AND TEAMS
################################################################################

  # An agent represents of a single soldier on the 3D scene. Always keep this in
  # mind when dealing with regular troops. A party may have 30 Swadian Knights.
  # They will form a single troop stack in the party, and they will all be
  # copies of the one and only Swadian Knight troop. However when the battle
  # starts, this stack will spawn 30 distinct Agents.

  # Agents do not persist - they only exist in the game for the duration of the
  # mission. As soon as the player returns to the world map, all agents who were
  # present on the scene immediately disappear. If this was a battle during a
  # normal game encounter, then the game will keep track of the battle results,
  # and depending on the number of agents killed from all sides the engine will
  # kill or wound some troops in the troop stacks of the parties who were
  # participating in the battle.

  # During the mission, all agents are split into teams. By default player and
  # his companions are placed into Team 0, but this may be changed in the
  # mission template or by code. Player's enemies are usually team 1 (though
  # again, this is not set in stone). Module System provides the modder with
  # a great degree of control over teams composition, relation to each other
  # (you can make hostile, allied or neutral teams, and you can have more than
  # one team on the scene).

# [ Z23 ] PRESENTATIONS
################################################################################

  # Presentations are a complex subject, because of their flexibility. Each
  # presentation is nothing more but a number of screen control elements, called
  # overlays. There are many types of overlays, each coming with it's own
  # behavior and looks. For as long as the presentation is running, you can
  # monitor the status of those overlays and change their looks, contents and
  # position on the screen.

  # Presentation is nothing but a set of triggers. There are only five triggers
  # that the presentation can have, but skillful control of them allows you to
  # do nearly everything you can think of.

  # ti_on_presentation_load fires only once when the presentation is started.
  # This is the place where you will usually create all overlays that your
  # presentation needs, initialize their looks and contents and put them to
  # their positions on the screen.

  # ti_on_presentation_event_state_change is probably the most important and
  # easy one. It fires every time some overlay in your presentation changes
  # state. For each type of overlay this means something. For a button overlay,
  # this means that the user has clicked the button. In this case, you will want
  # to run the code responsible for that button effects. So you can put a "Win"
  # button on your presentation, and when it's clicked, you can run the code
  # which will give all castles and towns in the game to you. :-)

  # ti_on_presentation_mouse_press trigger fires every time user clicks a mouse
  # button on one of presentation overlays, even if the overlay did not change
  # it's state as the result.

  # ti_on_presentation_mouse_enter_leave trigger fires when the mouse pointer
  # moves over one of presentation's overlays, or moves out of it. This might
  # be useful if you want your presentation to react to user's mouse movements,
  # not only clicks.

  # ti_on_presentation_run trigger will fire every frame (in other words, with
  # the frequency of your game FPS). You can put some code in this trigger if
  # you want your presentation to constantly do something even if the user is
  # passive.

  # Note that while a running presentation will usually pause your game until
  # you stop it, it is also possible to write presentations which will not stop
  # the game, but will run as the time goes. To see an example, go into any
  # battle in Warband and press Backspace. You will see the interface which
  # displays the mini-map of the battle, positions of all troops, and elements
  # that you can use to issue orders to your companions (if you have any). All
  # this is a presentation as well, called "prsnt_battle". And if you have
  # played multiplayer, then you might be interested to know that all menus,
  # including equipment selection for your character, are presentations as well.
