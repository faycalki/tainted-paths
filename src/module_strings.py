Parrying attacks with your weapon is a little bit more difficult than blocking them with a shield. When you are defending with a weapon, you are only protected from one direction, the direction in which your weapon is set. If you are blocking upwards, you will parry any overhead swings coming against you, but you will not stop thrusts or attacks to your sides. Either of these attacks would still be able to hit you. That's why, in order to survive without a shield, you must learn directional defence. Go pick up the quarterstaff by pressing the F key now to begin practice."),

For example, if your opponent is readying a thrust attack, pressing and holding the right mouse button will parry thrust attacks, but not side or overhead attacks. You must watch your opponent carefully and only initiate your parry AFTER the enemy starts to attack. If you start BEFORE he readies an attack, you may parry the wrong way altogether! Now it's time for you to move on to the next room, where you'll have to defend yourself against an armed opponent. Your task is to defend yourself successfully for twenty seconds with no equipment other than a simple quarterstaff. Your quarterstaff's attacks are disabled for this tutorial, so don't worry about attacking and focus on your defence instead. Move on to the next room when you are ready to initiate the fight."),

Try hitting the dummies as you pass them at full gallop -- this provides an extra challenge, but the additional speed added to your blow will allow you to do more damage.
